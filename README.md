## WHAT IS BEN?

- What is the **motivation**? <br>
The motivation of the projects is to create an exchange network for Bilkent University's students and staff. The network will enable students to share their ideas and exchange educational resources such as lecture books, slides, hardware components (Basys 3), and even the registered courses. 
- What are the **goals**? <br>
The goal of the team is to create a local network which is specialized for Bilkent University's students and staff. The network will enable the transfer of ideas, inside thoughts, announcements, and educational resources  among the users of the network. The goal of the projects is to make members of Bilkent University more accessible and enable an easy way to share ideas and components among the university. 
- What important **problem** will the web app solve? <br>
Unfortunately, the communication between members of Bilkent University is limited to WhatsApp groups which are established based on the majors. Cumulation of the same major students inside a single WhatsApp group isolates students from outside of their major community and limits their capabilities of meeting with different individuals. Many of the students could not participate in the in-campus social activities due to being informed lately. Another problem of current social communities is that the exchange of educational resources is limited inside major-groups. In case of an offer to sell or exchange of the books or hardware boards, students can only share the offer in specific year's major-groups which they are allowed to enter only. Even the student studying the same major in different years could not join the same WhatsApp group of majors legally. Also, Unfortunately, in case of an emergency such as an earthquake, WhatsApp groups could not establish a fast and efficient connection among the members due to the high intensity of information flow in a short time. This issue is also observed in the registration period which causes many students to lose the opportunity to exchange or take lectures that they are not assigned by pre-registration or are not suitable for their daily routines. 
- What sorts of **features** will the web app have? <br>
The app will allow the users to both connect with other users, in the way of private chat or forum discussion and exchange any stuff with each other in the marketplace. Market place will consist of many offers such as lecture books or hardware for the labs. Users will be able to share thoughts and exchange ideas about any topic they choose to share. In the course registration period, instead of writing to WhatsApp groups, students can offer exchange of lecture sections on a marketplace. Lost and found items also can be announced through the forums, which will increase the return ratio of lost items. Students will be able to share their ideas about the lectures and gain information from upper classes before attending/registration a course through the SRS. In case of emergency, our app will be able to turn itself into an emergency control center, which distributes all the donations via the marketplace and forum feature. 
- What are the **selling points** of the web app? <br>
App's reusability in both daily life and emergency situations is one of the key aspects of the App. A social network that has the capability of changing its structure to a control center that adjusts the exchanges of donated goods/services and coordinates the voluntaries among the Bilkent University via forum sections may decrease the time required to help the ones who need help in emergency conditions. Also, we believe that course exchange is a major problem in registration periods. The lack of communication led the students to not be able to take desired or even mandatory courses. A marketplace that is capable of offering open courses can help students to adjust their daily routines.   
- What makes this web app **interesting/cool**? <br>
One of the interesting sides of the app is its capability to change its structure. Its applicability in both regular circumstances and emergency scenarios. It might take less time to assist those in need in an emergency if a social network has the flexibility to transform into a control center. Also offering a marketplace for both educational purposes and lost/found is interesting.
