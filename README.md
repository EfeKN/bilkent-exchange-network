## WHAT IS BEN?

- What is the **motivation**? <br>
The motivation of the projects is to create an exchange network for Bilkent University's students and staff. The network will enable students to share their ideas and exchange educational resources such as lecture books, slides, hardware components (Basys 3), and even the registered courses. 
- What are the **goals**? <br>
The goal of the team is to create a local network which is specialized for Bilkent University's students and staff. The network will enable the transfer of ideas, inside thoughts, announcements, and educational resources  among the users of the network. The goal of the projects is to make members of Bilkent University more accessible and enable an easy way to share ideas and components among the university. 
- What important **problem** will the web app solve? <br>
Unfortunately, the communication between members of Bilkent University is limited to WhatsApp groups which are established based on the majors. Cumulation of the same major students inside a single WhatsApp group isolates students from outside of their major community and limits their capabilities of meeting with different individuals. Many of the students could not participate in the in-campus social activities due to being informed lately. Another problem of current social communities is that the exchange of educational resources is limited inside major-groups. In case of an offer to sell or exchange of the books or hardware boards, students can only share the offer in specific year's major-groups which they are allowed to enter only. Even the student studying the same major in different years could not join the same whatsApp group of majors legally. Also, Unfortunately, in case of an emergency such as an earthquake, WhatsApp groups could not establish a fast and efficient connection among the members due to the high intensity of information flow in a short time. This issue is also observed in the registration period which causes many students to lose the opportunity to exchange or take lectures that they are not assigned by pre-registration or are not suitable for their daily routines.
